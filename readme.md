# A filebrowser written in FastAPI

This repo is a little file browser I wrote in FastAPI.

I decided to do it because I had issues with Nginx's autoindex on small screens and my smartphone when browsing my SDR recordings.

## Active development

I may have to make drastic corrections to this so use at your own risk.
